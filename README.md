We have used Jmp pro and Weka for this project

1. built 20 different models using 4 different classification algorithms and 5 different attribute selection algorithms. 
2. Using J48 Decision tree classifier and OneR attribute selection algorithm, got the highest ROC area (.853).

Please go through the project report and PPT to recreate and undestand the project in detail.
